                <p>Hi there! I am a creative Digital, Multimedia, and Graphic designer with a special interest in layout
                    design,
                    video editing, and UX design. I have previous working experience creating content for different SoMe
                    channels,
                    as well as designing internal brand visuals. In addition, I have also worked in the development,
                    maintenance,
                    and updating of the online shop of KIDKII, I have created visual content for the online shop, and I
                    have also
                    developed case studies for a design studio. For six months, I worked as a Digital Design Intern at
                    Dot.vu, a
                    Danish company that creates interactive experiences for B2B companies. My role involved creating

                    and creating
